# task-mannager

This HTML code represents a simple Task Manager application with version number 0.1. The page features a background image of a notepad. The main container (task-container) includes a heading, a form for adding tasks, and an unordered list (taskList) to display tasks.

The styling is designed for a visually appealing interface with a transparent background for the task container and a subtle background for each task in the list. The "Add task" button triggers the addTask function, which dynamically adds new tasks to the list. Each task in the list includes a "Delete" button to remove the respective task when clicked.
